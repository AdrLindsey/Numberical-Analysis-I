# Numberical-Analysis-I

### This is a colleciton of homework assignments and mini projects from Numerical Analysis I.

MATH 7203. Numerical Analysis 1. 4 Hours.
Introduces methods and techniques used in contemporary number crunching. Covers floating-point computations involving scalars, vectors, and matrices; solvers for sparse and dense linear systems; matrix decompositions; integration of functions and solutions of ordinary differential equations (ODEs); and Fast Fourier transform. Focuses on finding solutions to practical, real-world problems. Knowledge of programming in Matlab is assumed. Knowledge of other programming languages would be good but not required.  

Numerical Analysis I is a graduate level course at Northeastern University's Mathematics department by Professor Stuart Brorson.
