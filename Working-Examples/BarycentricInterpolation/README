This is a class demo.  It demonstrates barycentric interpolation as
advocated by Trefethen.

This Python version shows how to do Barycentric interpolation by first
computing coefficients and caching them, then reusing the coefficients
each time a new interpolant x is requested.

The thing to run is test_barycentric.py.
