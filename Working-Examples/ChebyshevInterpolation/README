This compares interpolation of a difficult function performed 
by the Lagrange polynomial using an equally-spaced grid against
a Lagrange polynomial evaluated on a Chebyshev node grid.

The things to run are:

test_equalspaced_interpolation.m -- interpolates the famous
1/(1 + 16*x^2) function at equal-spaced points.  The interpolation is
performed using the Lagrange polynomial.  The Runge phenomenon
is very obvious.

test_chebyshev_interpolation.m -- interpolates the 1/(1 + 16*x^2)
function at Chebyshev nodes using the Lagrange polynomial.  The Runge
phenomenon is very much reduced.
