This is a class demo of three quadrature methods:

1.  Simpson's 1/3 rule.
2.  Gauss-Legendre quadrature.
3.  Clenshaw-Curtis

Each method has its own unit test fcn called test_*.  The unit test is
just to verify the method is correct.

I also run the three methods against the test 
functions  (19) and (20) from SIAM Review March 2021, p. 167.  The
goal is to see how each method works when run against a "difficult"
function.  The thing to run is run_compare_methods.m.  It creates a
plot of the method's error vs. number of sample points for each
method. 

For Gaussian quadrature I grabbed the function lgwt.m from the Matlab
file exchange.  It computes the Gauss weights and nodes from the
Legendre Polynomial.  The license accompanying this file is present in
the .zip file.
